Hello!

For your convenience, the repository includes both a compressed file of the project and an uncompressed version of the project. You can choose one of the following options to run the project:

If you prefer to use the uncompressed version of the project, simply delete the compressed file from the folder and run the project through Xcode.
If you want to use the compressed version, extract its contents to a convenient location and then open the project in Xcode.
Thank you for your attention!
